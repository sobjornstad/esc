Developer Manual
================

The esc developer manual documents the API and internals of esc
and describes how you add custom functionality and change the behavior of esc.
If you're looking for information on installing or running esc
or performing calculations,
you want the :ref:`User Manual`.

If you haven't built an esc plugin before,
start with the :ref:`Operations` section,
which walks you through creating a plugin that implements a simple operation.
