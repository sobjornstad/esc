esc
===

**esc** (pronounced /esk/) is an Extensible Stack-based Calculator
designed for efficiency and customizability.
What does this mean?

* esc is *stack-based*,
  operating using a `Reverse Polish Notation`_ (RPN)-like syntax.
  Rather than typing ``2 + 2`` and pressing an equals key,
  you enter the two numbers ``2`` and ``2`` onto :ref:`the stack <Stack>`,
  then choose ``+`` to add them.
  This can be slightly awkward at first,
  but it means no parentheses are necessary,
  and for most people it becomes faster and more elegant
  than the standard algebraic method
  with a small amount of practice.
  In addition, it is considerably easier to customize and program.

* esc is *extensible*.
  If you frequently need to
  multiply two numbers together, add five, and then divide the result by pi,
  you can add a function to the calculator to do this specific operation
  using a couple of lines of Python code.
  The extension features are simple enough to be accessible
  even to people who do not know Python
  or have little to no programming experience.

  esc operations are arbitrary Python code, so if you want to get fancy,
  they can get arbitrarily complicated.
  You can even call APIs to perform calculations or get data!

* esc is *fast*, *simple*, and *terminal-based*.
  All you need is a working terminal (at least 80Ã—24)
  and your keyboard.
