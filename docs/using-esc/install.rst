Installation
============

The easiest way to install esc is through pip:
::

    pip install esc-calc

This will install a package ``esc`` and an executable ``esc`` script,
so you should be able to run esc like:
::

    python -m esc

Or just:
::

    esc

(This latter option may not work depending on your system configuration.)

You can also install esc from source.
Find it `on GitHub`_.
