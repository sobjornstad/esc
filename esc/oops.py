class FunctionExecutionError(EscError):
    r"""
    A broad exception type that occurs when the code within an operation
    function couldn't be executed successfully for some reason. Examples
    include:

    - a number is in the middle of being entered and isn't a valid number
    - a function performed an undefined operation like dividing by zero
    - there are too many or too few items on the stack
    - a function directly raises this error due to invalid input
      or inability to complete its task for some other reason

    :class:`FunctionExecutionError`\ s normally result in the ``__str__`` of
    the exception being printed to the status bar, so exception messages
    should be concise.

    A :class:`FunctionExecutionError` may be raised directly, or one of its
    subclasses may be used.
    """

class InsufficientItemsError(FunctionExecutionError):
    """
    Raised directly by operations functions that request the entire stack to
    indicate not enough items are on the stack to finish their work, or by
    the menu logic when an operation requests more parameters than items on
    the stack.

    Functions may use the simplified form of the exception, providing an int
    describing the number of items that should have been on the stack for the
    :attr:`number_required` constructor parameter. esc will then reraise the
    exception with a more useful message; a fallback message is provided in
    case this doesn't happen for some reason.
