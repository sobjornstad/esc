    An item placed on esc's stack. At its root, this is a number, but it gets
    more complicated than that!

    For one, we need a numeric value for calculations as well as a string
    value to display on the screen. The methods :meth:`finish_entry` and
    :meth:`_string_repr_from_value` are used to update the numeric and string
    representations from the other. We could dynamically compute the string
    representation with reasonable performance, but see the next paragraph
    for why this isn't helpful.

    For another, a stack item may be *incomplete*
    (:attr:`is_entered` attribute = ``False``).
    That's because the user doesn't enter a number all at once --
    it will typically consist of multiple keystrokes.
    If so, there won't be a decimal representation
    until we call :meth:`finish_entry`.
