commands.py - implement menus, operations, and other things that show up
              in the commands window

We use menus to register and keep track of the commands the user can choose.
Actual calculator functionality is defined in functions.py (and in user
plugins).

First come EscCommand and its subclasses, which implement both menus and
operations (which wrap the actual Python functions in functions.py that
perform calculations) in a composite tree pattern. Then come
faux-constructors (actually functions) which can be imported from
functions.py and called to register functions as operations. Through these
constructors, all registered operations and submenus end up reachable from
the main menu.

    :param description:
        A very brief description of the operation this function implements,
        to be displayed next to it on the menu.

    :param retain:
        If ``True``, the items bound to this function's arguments
        will remain on the stack on successful execution.
        The default is ``False``
        (meaning the function's return value replaces
        whatever was there before --
        the usual behavior of an RPN calculator).
    :param log_as:
        A specification describing what appears
        in the :guilabel:`History` window after executing this function.
        It may be ``None`` (the default), ``UNOP`` or ``BINOP``,
        a .format() string, or a callable.

        * If it is ``None``, the *description* is used.

        * If it is the module constant :const:`esc.commands.UNOP`
          or :const:`esc.commands.BINOP`,
          the log string is a default suitable
          for many unary or binary operations:
          for ``UNOP`` it is
          :samp:`{description} {argument} = {return}`
          and for ``BINOP`` it is
          :samp:`{argument} {key} {argument} = {return}`.

          .. note::
            If the function being decorated does not take one or two arguments,
            respectively,
            using ``UNOP`` or ``BINOP`` will raise a
            :class:`ProgrammingError <esc.oops.ProgrammingError>`.

        * If it is a format string, positional placeholders are replaced
          with the parameters to the function in sequence,
          then the return values.
          Thus, a function with two arguments ``bos`` and ``sos``
          returning a tuple of two values replaces
          ``{0}`` with ``bos``, ``{1}`` with ``sos``,
          and ``{2}`` and ``{3}`` with the two return values.

        * If it is a callable, the parameters will be examined and bound
          by name to the following (none of these parameters are required,
          but arguments other than these will raise a
          :class:`ProgrammingError <esc.oops.ProgrammingError>`).

          :args: a list of the arguments the function requested
          :retval: a list of values the function returned
          :registry: the current :class:`Registry` instance

          The function should return an appropriate string.
    :param simulate:
        If ``True`` (the default), function execution will be simulated
        when the user looks at the help page for the function,
        so they can see what would happen to the stack
        if they actually chose the function.
        You should disable this option
        if your function is extremely slow or has side effects
        (e.g., changing the system clipboard, editing registers).

    In addition to placing the function on the menu,
    the function is wrapped with the following magic.

    1. Function parameters are bound according to the following rules:

       * Most parameters are bound
         to a slice of values at the bottom of the stack, by position.
         If the function has one parameter,
         it receives :ref:`bos <Terminology and notation>`;
         if the function has two parameters,
         the first receives sos and the second bos;
         and so on.
         The parameters can have any names (see exceptions below).
         Using ``bos`` and ``sos`` is conventional for general operations,
         but if the operation is implementing some kind of formula,
         it may be more useful to name the parameters
         for their meaning in the formula.

       * By default, passed parameters are of type `Decimal`_.
         If the parameter name ends with ``_str``,
         it instead receives a string representation
         (this is exactly what shows up in the calculator window,
         so it's helpful when doing something display-oriented
         like copying to the clipboard).
         If the parameter name ends with ``_stackitem``,
         it receives the complete :class:`StackItem`,
         containing both of those representations and a few other things besides.

       * A varargs parameter, like ``*args``,
         receives the entire contents of the stack as a tuple.
         This is invalid with any other parameters except ``registry``.
         The ``_str`` and ``_stackitem`` suffixes still work.
         Again, it can have any name; ``*stack`` is conventional for esc operations.

       * The special parameter name ``registry``
         receives a :class:`Registry <esc.registers.Registry>` instance
         containing the current state of all registers.
         Using this parameter is generally discouraged;
         see :ref:`Registry` for details.

    2. The function has a callable attached to it as an attribute,
       called ``ensure``, which can be used to test the function at startup
       to ensure the function never stops calculating the correct answers
       due to updates or other issues:

       .. code-block:: python

            def add(sos, bos):
                return sos + bos
            add.ensure(before=[1, 2, 3], after=[1, 5])
